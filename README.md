# Cable-Like-Streaming-Site

*For Educational and Research Purposes Only*<br />
Hello,<br />
This is a site I made using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript to make use of the consumet api and give an example of a more effective way of streaming shows. I modeled it off of cable #television in which the user chooses a channel and shows of that category play one after the other. <br /><image src = "images/Screenshot 2023-02-24 at 1.17.44 AM.png" style = "width: 700px;">
